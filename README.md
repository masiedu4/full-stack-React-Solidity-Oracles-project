# Solidity Project with Data Feeds and Oracles from Chaninlink

This project shows how to use Solidity to fetch data from an Oracle into a onchain smart contract.

The underlying concept is how smart contracts and chainlink data feeds interact.

## Key Concepts Applied

- Data Feeds and Fetching External Data
- Reentrancy Check
- Smart Contract Ownership
- Decimals in Smart Contracts
- Using Hardhatt and deploying on a testnet
- Using library...for
